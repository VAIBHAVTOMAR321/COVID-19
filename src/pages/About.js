    Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.
    COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that emerged in December 2019.
    COVID-19 can be severe, and has caused millions of deaths around the world as well as lasting health problems in some who have survived the illness.
    The coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed with a test.
    The best way to protect yourself is to get vaccinated and boosted when you are eligible, follow testing guidelines, wear a mask, wash your hands and practice physical distancing.

        How does it spread?

    <div className='about'>
    As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors.

    Signs and symptoms include respiratory symptoms and include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and sometimes death.

    Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include frequent cleaning of hands using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; covering the nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or disposable tissue when coughing and sneezing; and avoiding close contact with anyone that has a fever and cough.
    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.

    To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
    Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.
    Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
    Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
    Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
    Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
    Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
    Stay home if you feel unwell.
    If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.
